how will map be able to create reports for specific municipalities?



townships in TIGER/Line shapefiles?


free_distribution, fresh_produce - all others are False

green grocer - less than 20 sites, not free_distribution. being ingested by Cat. not sure which payment types they accept 


GroupTypeThree

412 Food Rescue - lots of duplicates between this list and the other


send Justin a list of duplicate places with the 412 Food Rescue list, using the Google Places API


DSL develop mapping of GroupTypes to open_to_spec_group, send to Justin for review

Justin look into seemingly public sites where "Food Bank - Get Help" is blank and let DSL know
