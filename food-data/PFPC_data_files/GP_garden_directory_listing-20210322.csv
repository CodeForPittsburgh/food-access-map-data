Gardener members participate by caring for our collectively shared garden plots where we are growing a perennial food forest, or by adopting their own plot to care for independently. While there is no cost for adopting a plot, all garden members are expected to maintain their own plot on a weekly basis, and select 2-4 weeks per season to maintain common spaces in the garden by weed whacking, mowing, and hand-weeding. Our multiracial collective of gardeners is made up of Garfield residents, most of whom live within 5 blocks of the garden.

community-garden,gardenseacreature@gmail.com,,,,https://www.facebook.com/octopusgardenpittsburgh/,"Since it opened in 2009, the Octopus Garden in Pittsburgh's Friendship neighborhood supports life in many ways, some of which you might not expect. Beyond growing fruits and veggies, this garden grows community.

A number of the plots in the garden not only feed those who tend to the plants, but also families—young and old—who live in the neighborhoods bordering the garden and a need a bit of help lowering their food bills.

The garden also provides a beautiful backdrop for local schools to use in the spring and early summer as an outdoor classroom, where students can see the science they learn in books come to life before their eyes. Neighbors also use this space for get-togethers and celebrations of all kinds. Beyond being the home of many plants and trees, the Octopus Garden helps to grow and inspire art. Our garden chalkboard encourages kids of all ages to draw and leave messages for others to enjoy or build upon. The lending library keeps a continual flow of children's books of all kinds circulating into the neighborhood.

Yet, our friends Octavia and Doris might very well be the most charming art features in our garden. Both of these beauties were created by Pittsburgh-based artists Lauren Jean McLaughlin and Bob Ziller with the help of neighbors in Friendship.

Octavia, our namesake, holds court in the center of the garden, visible to all who pass by. No matter which end of the garden you enter, Octavia greets you with a smile—a fringe benefit of having two faces and 8 tentacles.

Doris (a Fabulousa Lochnessa Kaleidoscopa Mosaica), a cousin of the infamous Loch Ness monster, doesn't revel in the spotlight as much as Octavia. Built to be completely weatherproof, she lives in the back of our garden, where she can keep watch, shelter the occasional sparrow in her tail's built-in bird house, offer a seat to neighbors looking for a place to relax, and entertain her friends with the kaleidoscopes inside her many peep holes.

Octavia and Doris transformed this space into so much more than a garden. They lend a special kind of magic and whimsy—they give our garden its identity.

Gardening with neighbors is fun all on its own, but when you combine it with art, the possibilities are endless. We know that our garden just wouldn't be the same if it weren't for these two sculptures.",133 South Aiken Avenue,Pittsburgh,US,"133 South Aiken Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",40.463591,-79.936771,15206,Pennsylvania,The Octopus Garden,,published,Kristin Hughes

community-garden,,,,,https://hamnettgarden.wordpress.com,"Standing empty and abandoned since 1993, the once grand Regency Apartments were a dark spot in Hamnett Place, with its collapsing porches and falling bricks posing a danger to neighborhood kids who played around it. Even as the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks foundation began to restore houses elsewhere on Jeanette, the Regency  was a hulking ruin at the end of the block, turning Hamnett Way into a sunless and foreboding alley.

In 2006, PHLF acquired the Regency along with several other properties along Jeanette, Holland and Rebecca which are now completely restored. In 2009, the Regency, which was beyond repair, was demolished, bringing light back to the block and leaving a large empty lot. After polling the locals in a series of planning meetings, PHLF found that what the community wanted on the lot was a green space. For two years, local biofuels nonprofit GTECH Strategies planted sunflowers on the lot to be harvested for fuel, but the flowers never really took in the dense clay soil.

Meanwhile, Hamnett Place community members were  organizing on their own to create a community garden. Interest in the project was strong, but the group was unable to find a suitable lot for the garden.

In late 2010, PHLF connected with the Hamnett Place Community Garden group and along with GTECH, the two organizations applied for an Allegheny Grows Grant. A collaboration of Allegheny County, Grow Pittsburgh and the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, the grant provided materials, plants and technical support for the new garden for two years. After years of planning and foiled plans, ground was broken on the garden in the spring of 2011. 16 plots were quickly leased to Hamnett Place residents and plants were supplied by Allegheny Grows as well as local nursery Garden Dreams.

In the 2012 growing season, the garden increased in size to 20 beds, added community beds for berry bushes and herbs, and PHLF and the garden group are currently working on a landscaping plan called Piano Place (link to piano place page on our site) for the remainder of the lot.
