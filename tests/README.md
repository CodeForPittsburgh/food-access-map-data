[Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/) is an application used for automating web browser testing. The Food Access Map uses it to test web browser functionality and make sure that everything is functioning as intended. 

To get started using Selenium: 

1. Add the Selenium extension to your browser (either Chrome or Firefox). 
2. Click the extension button on your web browser to open the application.
3. From the application screen, click "Open an existing project"
4. Navigate to your local copy of the Github repository, and open "Food Access Map.side", currently located in the "tests" directory. 

From here, you can select between tests and run them by typing either "Ctrl + Shift + R" to run all tests, or "Ctrl + R" to run the current test.
